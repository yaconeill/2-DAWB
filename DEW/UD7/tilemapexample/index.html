// the empty '' (quotes) could be filled with the id of a specific html <div> element in which the game canvas should be created 
// preload: create: update: debug:  get the actual names of your functions .. you could name your preload function "loadit" and your update function "doit"  then this line would look like this
// var game = new Phaser.Game(800, 640, Phaser.CANVAS, '',{preload:loadit, create:create, update:doit});

// but why would you do that :)
